## Reading an arbitrary number of files into Stata made easy

### Abstract
The Statalist is filled with threads from users who all want to do the same thing. You probably have run into the issue yourself. You have dozens, hundreds, or thousands of files that you need to combine into a single dataset for analysis and want to figure out the most efficient way to do it. In this talk, Iâ€™ll describe readit, a new command that solves this problem and can solve the same problem when used across multiple file types using the Python API introduced in Stata 16. The readit command can operate in a few different ways that provide significant flexibility built on the I/O capabilities of the pandas package in Python.
