                    <p class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-transition-speed="slow">But they all share at least one constraint due to the functionality of <code>append</code>.</p>
                    <p class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-transition-speed="slow"><code>append</code>ing files requires them to already be in Stata's file format.</p>
                    <p class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-transition-speed="slow">If the files aren't already Stata files, then you also deal with I/O performance bottlenecks.</p>
                    <p class="fragment fade-in-then-out" data-transition-speed="slow">And while <code>frames</code> supports joins/merges, it doesn't support union/append operations at this time.</p>
                    <p class="fragment fade-in" data-transition-speed="slow">It is also likely that this is constrained by serial operation.</p>

                        <li>As the number of files grows, so too will some of the performance issues/penalties.</li>
                        <li>The I/O Bottleneck is driven primarily by the need to either write Stata formatted files to disk, or to write tempfiles to disk.</li>
                        <li>The comment about frames also makes the assumption that frames are storing all the representations in memory and not writing data to temp files on the disk.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><code>Python which</code> will determine if there is a package of the same name available, but does not return the <code>__version__</code> string.</li>
                    <li>Datetime variables have not been tested.</li>
                    <li>Products like StatTransfer can actually create issues when they attempt to optimize the storage of the data on disk.</li>
                </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>This means that it isn't the easiest thing to test for dependencies at the moment.</li>
                        <li>The internals of the program also include some data type inference heuristics which become necessary when working with missing/optimized files.</li>
                        <li>If the data types are all perfectly consistent when being read into Pandas, there is a need to coerce the data to a consistent type.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Currently, it isn't possible to specify which variables to rename on a file-by-file basis.  With future releases this should be possible, and will likely require similar non-traditional Stata syntax.</li>
                        <li>Unit testing isn't the easiest thing at the moment since all of the code needs to be controlled by the Stata instance.  By decoupling more of the code base (or based on the talk) it might be possible to more rigorously test the code prior to a wider release.</li>
                        <li>Right now users will need to have modules installed on their machines.  Many Python developers use virtual environments so any modules/packages are installed locally to a specific directory.  Making the code pip installable will make it easier to manage dependencies.</li>
                        <li>Using a JSON schema means proving a more robust way to test/check syntax errors in the specification of the configuration files.  It also means defining standardized semantics that can be used to define how the program should operate.</li>
                        <li>The current version of readit uses a class and methods to work its magic.  This doesn't really work so well for multiprocessing (e.g., non-shared memory based concurrency).  Multithreading may not be the sole solution either.</li>
                        <li>Multithreading support will be added prior to any multiprocessing support since it uses a shared memory model.</li>
